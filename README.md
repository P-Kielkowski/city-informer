Simple microservices based app to learn basic aspects of configuring and deploying distributed applications with docker &amp; kubernetes.
  Dont pay attention for code quality - It's just a simple API for education.
 It's very usefull to configure development environment as close to production as It is possible - eg. https with SSL cert and some sort of reverse proxy like nginx. That's what I want also to learn here. ENJOY !
